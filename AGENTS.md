## Development Process

Before starting any implementation work related to the BiDiB Arduino library, you **must** consult the `implementation_plan.md` document. This document outlines the agreed-upon development phases and the logical order of implementation.

After completing a development phase or a significant feature, you **must** update the `implementation_plan.md` to reflect the current status of the project.
